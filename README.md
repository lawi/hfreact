# HappyFour ported to TypeScript React

The Engine Code has been made back in the 80s.
It is a kind of Hello World to test programming languages.

Originally it has been mede in Pascal.
Later in f.e.  C, C#, GDScript, Java

The engine has a fixed search depth of nine half moves.
It uses alpha beta pruning to reduce tree size.

Have fun!
Michael
